1. MMD: Definition

1. (Biased) Empirical estimator for the MMD


1. Properties of MMD in RKHS

a. MMD as the distance between mean embeddings 

b. MMD^2 and an unbiased estimator

1. A test for the biased estimator, using McDiarmid bound

1. Overview of other two-sample tests

a. Kolmogorov-Smirnov

b. Earth-movers distance 



1. Comparing power of two-sample tests (Figure 5 in Gretton, et al. 2012)
