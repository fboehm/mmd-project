# mmdproject

<!-- badges: start -->

The goal of mmdproject is to learn about and present maximum mean
discrepancy in machine learning. It is a method - and test - for
comparing two distributions. I still donâ€™t know how it compares with
Kolmogorov Smirnov, but I anticipate that the 2012 JMLR piece discusses
this point.
